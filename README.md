# Beyond Random: Rethinking Item Embedding Initializations in Sequential Recommenders

In this work, we address the typical naive random initialization of the item embeddings in the modern sequential recommender system, and present the first comprehensive analysis of embedding initialization strategies, examining five approaches: Truncated SVD, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), NetMF, Node2vec, and LEPORID.
